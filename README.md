# event_finder_app
**Project description**

Build a React app where users can view and promote upcoming events. 

**Background of the problem statement:**  
You are a web developer at a company called FindMyMovies. 
The company has decided to launch a new app called FindMyEvents where users can view and add upcoming events in their region. 

Backend development has been outsourced and frontend will be developed in-house. 

During sprint planning, you agree to lead this project and develop an app that will let users find events using APIs that backend engineers will provide. 

The tasks you are responsible for: 

● Building the application in React

● Setting up a JSON server for testing until backend APIs are ready

● Managing the state using Redux

You must use the following tools: 

● React: To build the application

● Redux: To manage the state of components in the application

● JSON Server: To build a placeholder backend for app development and testing

● React Router: To navigate within the app using URL links

● Bootstrap: To accelerate the development

● The app should be responsive.

● There should only be one source of truth for state management. 

● The app should have functionalities for users to create, view, and delete events.
